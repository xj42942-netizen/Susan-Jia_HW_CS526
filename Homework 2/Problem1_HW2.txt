Problem 1: Advantage of Tail Pointer in Linked List


The main advantage of using a tail pointer in a linked list is improved 
efficiency for append operations.

Without Tail Pointer:
- Time Complexity: O(n) 
- Must traverse the entire list to find the last node

With Tail Pointer:
- Time Complexity: O(1)
- Direct access to the last node without traversal


The tail pointer uses minimal extra memory (one pointer) but provides significant performance improvement, changing append from O(n) to O(1). Besides reducing the append complexity, a tail pointer also makes it easier to implement a queue efficiently.
