Problem 1 – Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort
--------------------------------------------------

This program sorts three input files:
input_small.txt
input_medium.txt
input_large.txt

For each file, it runs:
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Insertion Sort

Outputs are saved to:
problem1_small_output.txt
problem1_medium_output.txt
problem1_large_output.txt

How to Run:
Inside the HW6 folder, run:
python3 Problem1_SJ.py

The program automatically loads all input files.

Problem 2 – Radix Sort
----------------------

This program sorts three input files:
input_small.txt
input_medium.txt
input_large.txt

It applies Radix Sort to each file.

Outputs are saved to:
small_radix_output.txt
medium_radix_output.txt
large_radix_output.txt

How to Run:
Inside the HW6 folder, run:
python3 Problem2_SJ.py

Problem 3 – Gale-Shapley Algorithm
----------------------------------

This program processes three preference list files:
marriage_ten.txt
marriage_hundred.txt
marriage_thousand.txt

It computes the stable matching for each data set using the Gale-Shapley algorithm.

Outputs are saved to:
ten_output.txt
hundred_output.txt
thousand_output.txt

How to Run:
Inside the HW6 folder, run:
python3 Problem3_SJ.py
