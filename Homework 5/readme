Problem 1 – Binary Search Tree
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File: Problem1_SJ.py

This program builds a Binary Search Tree (BST) using random numbers between 1 and 1000.
It includes methods to add, delete, search, and print nodes in the tree.

Steps performed:
1. Generate a random list containing between 5 and 50 numbers.  
2. Build a BST and print the tree using inorder traversal.  
3. Delete one random node and print the updated tree.  
4. Add one new random node and print again.  
5. Search for one existing node shown as “Found”，and one number not in the tree shown as “Not Found”.

How I ran it:  
I ran the program in the terminal using the command:
python3 Problem1_SJ.py  
The program printed the output in the terminal, and I saved the result as a text file for submission.

Problem 2 – Vowel Morse Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File: Problem2_SJ.py

This program reads Morse code sequences from four text files:  
vowel_input1.txt, vowel_input2.txt, vowel_input3.txt, and vowel_input4.txt.  
Each file contains one Morse code string.  
The algorithm calculates how many different ways the string can be split into valid vowel codes.

The valid Morse codes for vowels are:
A = .-  
E = .  
I = ..  
O = ---  
U = ..-

The program uses a dynamic programming approach to count all possible vowel combinations.

How I ran it:  
I ran the program in the terminal using the command:
python3 Problem2_SJ.py  
The results were displayed in the terminal and saved as text output files.

Problem 3 – Longest Alternating Increasing Sequence
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File: Problem3_SJ.py

This program reads six text files:  
longest_seq1.txt, longest_seq2.txt, longest_seq3.txt, longest_seq4.txt, longest_seq5.txt, and longest_seq6.txt.  
Each file contains two integer lists (A and B).  
The goal is to find the longest sequence that alternates between A and B,  
where each next number is greater than the previous one.

The algorithm uses recursion with memoization to find the longest valid alternating sequence.

How I ran it:  
I ran the program in the terminal using the command:
python3 Problem3_SJ.py  
The results were printed in the terminal and saved as text files as well.
